              After that, I transitioned to living among civilians and experienced life as any typical child. It was during this time that I began to skip school and spend countless hours at cyber cafés, which were booming businesses at the time.

              However, the issue was that I needed money to keep returning to the cyber café. This led me to discover a tool called <strong>Process Suspender</strong>, which allowed me to stop selected background processes. In my case, I used it for hacking purposes.
