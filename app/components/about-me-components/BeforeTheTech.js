              Growing up in a military environment, my family and I frequently relocated, adapting to new places and cultures. I spent much of my time with friends who shared similar experiences, and it was here that I first learned the values of teamwork and discipline.

              Our days were filled with military-style activities such as marching, handling firearms, and more, especially during my time at a military camp near Sungai Petani, Kedah. These formative experiences helped shape my character and work ethic.
