              Growing up in a military environment, my family and I frequently relocated, adapting to new places and cultures. I spent much of my time with friends who shared similar experiences, and it was here that I first learned the values of teamwork and discipline.

              After that, I transitioned to living among civilians and experienced life as any typical child. It was during this time that I began to skip school and spend countless hours at cyber cafés, which were booming businesses at the time.

              However, the issue was that I needed money to keep returning to the cyber café. This led me to discover a tool called <strong class="text-primary">Process Suspender</strong>, which allowed me to stop selected background processes. In my case, I used it for hacking purposes.
